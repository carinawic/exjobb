Köra experiment tar alltid 3h att göra

autocorrelation plot
augmented-dickey-fuller-test
guidelines

stationary, p-value: 0.04
ARIMA should be enough

differencing term -> bättre resultat

one input feaute had only 4 years
8 years

more data gave worse results

mean f1 score (+ std dev)

ranking test neural network?


tell which several setups were good - arima and lstm

chosing feature

pilot test for every design decision
grid search 

how arima calculates p values

order parameter

opposition
attend 2 presentation
hold a presentation

technical meeting with Erik
else Slack

check when pawel wants the report

give thesis to Erik last week may/first week june

p values
statistics

how much data do we need to say a p value

sarimax model gives me a p value even though we have very little data
p value how much the feature helpts the model

compare the two models
