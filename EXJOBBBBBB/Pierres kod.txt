How to run the code

Keep in mind that some of the code will not work because you need access to the database to make it work. 
However, the Baseline part of the code can be used without database so you don't need to have access to it.

In the root of the archive, I included the file Train_baseline_snippet.py . 
When everything is installed, you can run, after making sure that you are in the right conda environment, 

$python Train_baseline_snippet.py. 

This code should create the pandas dataframe containing all the data needed for the training of the baseline, 
train the baseline and plot some graphs to show the results of the training. I hope that it will help you to get started.

The code that will be interesting for you is in
