1. find the seasonalities by
- looking at the data
- following these tutorials

find and remove seasonality? Do this first to analyze if the data is even seasonal weekly and yearly, (clearly yearly)

Try to fit ARIMAS on it with yearly OR weekly seasonality (depending on the results from 1)

Then optimize the ARIMA to fit seasonality (SARIMA, VARMA?)

ARIMA for multivariate data here? aka VARMA

How to do multi seasonal data with ARIMA:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50711771/multiple-seasonality-time-series-analysis-in-python

SARIMA is designed for single seasonality
we can try Fourier terms
or removing a seasonality like the week (depending on results from 1)


What else are there: (for the report)

TBABS - another method

prophet - can also do multivariate analysis
https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html

"Prophet will by default fit weekly and yearly seasonalities, if the time series is more than two cycles long. It will also fit daily seasonality for a sub-daily time series"
