LSTM: it takes about 5? minutes to run all 100 epochs, should time this!

We just put in the data

LSTM errors

Figure_1
Train Score: 1105.37 RMSE
Test Score: 5851.86 RMSE
Train Score: 845.68 MAE
Test Score: 1469.65 MAE
Train Score: 0.04 MAPE
Test Score: 0.07 MAPE

Figure_2
Train Score: 1266.25 RMSE
Test Score: 1867.72 RMSE
Train Score: 981.01 MAE
Test Score: 1185.57 MAE
Train Score: 0.04 MAPE
Test Score: 0.05 MAPE

we think that it might be overfitting to one feature

now we normalize the media_input features between 0 and 1 
normalizing is a good preprocessing step so to prevent that one extreme feature value has big impact on the result 

Figure_3
Train Score: 2763.43 RMSE
Test Score: 2939.29 RMSE
Train Score: 1981.86 MAE
Test Score: 2096.28 MAE
Train Score: 0.09 MAPE
Test Score: 0.09 MAPE

But we lose the outlier

theory: when scaling so narrowly, we lose some precision due to underflow

now we scale (0,30) instead

Figure_4
Train Score: 2728.17 RMSE
Test Score: 2917.90 RMSE
Train Score: 2154.31 MAE
Test Score: 2338.33 MAE
Train Score: 0.10 MAPE
Test Score: 0.10 MAPE

now we scale (0,1000) instead
Figure_5
Train Score: 1192.27 RMSE
Test Score: 1421.99 RMSE
Train Score: 901.42 MAE
Test Score: 1003.54 MAE
Train Score: 0.04 MAPE
Test Score: 0.04 MAPE

better accuracy but we see the one outlier around 1020

running experiment again
