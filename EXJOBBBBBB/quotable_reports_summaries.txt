        In naive bayes, it compares two methods of character level n-grams and word-level n-grams, and analyzes their comparable effectiveness. They finally conclude that character level n-grams gave the best results for the purpose of detecting hate speech on twitter. 
        "We learned that n-character with combinations of 1-3 characters was most efficient in detecting hate speech on twitter. "

    Other publications
        Since that Sam Hamra (bachelor thesis) publication (June 6, 2017), more work has been done in this field.
        One study done by Vedant Kshirsagar in 2019 under the name “Detecting Hate tweets — Twitter Sentiment Analysis” found another algorithm to outperform the Naive Bayes used by Sam Hamra and Boran Sahindal. [5]
        Kshirsagar writes “logistic regression gives us the best AUC. [...] Compare this to Naive Bayes which shows a poor false positive performance”
        The same year, another report was published on the same topic: “Automated Hate Speech Detection on Twitter” by Garima Koushik et. al, using the very same machine learning model as Kshirsagar, receiving exceptionally high accuracy of  hate speech classifications. [6]
