Model A considering only seasonality and media investment
- Accuracy 60%

Model B (Model A with added Weather)
- Accuracy 70%

Model C (Model A with added Covid)
- Accuracy 70%

Model D (Model A with Weather AND Covid)
- Accuracy 70%

Model E (Model A with News)
- Accuracy 70%

Feature importance

Assess how much the additional features each affect the predictive of the model using the methods:
Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA)
Calculate an accuracy score for the model using all features. Then, one feature at the time, scramble that feature and calculate the decrease in accuracy.
Single Feature Importance (SFI)
For each feature, consider only one feature, then calculate the accuracy of the model when using only that feature.
