1. Finish chapter about why we chose certain parameters for ARIMA and LSTM, by running experiments  - with different number of layers, different number of nodes per layer - when we have the correct number of layers and such, reason about scaling or not scaling the marketing data, reasoning about the extreme outlier. NOTE to change loopback to 7.
2. Finish the fucking introduction and send it to Erik
3. Add all results regarding weather, exchange rate, marketing investment, and salary (around 25th) FOR BOTH LSTM AND SARIMAX 
4. Improve “around 25th” to “”around salary date
5. Calculate p value for percent increase around salary date
